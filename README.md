I wanted to connect a BBC micro:bit to an android device using bluetooth but I couldn't find anything online that was very helpful. I was having trouble getting the data from the micro:bit so I wrote this to try to understand why.  It seemed to be related to timings of events.
The coding is a bit maverick, but it's quicker to write working solution than to find the optimum solution.
